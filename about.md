# About

OSM Names project offers downloadable list of placenames derived primarily from OpenStreetMap database. Easy to use TSV (tab separated value) format simplifies handling of the community curated data with over 21 million streets, towns, cities and administrative units from every country all over the world. Complete compressed dump has about 1.5 gigabytes.

Each gazetteer record comes with the coverage area (bounding box), hierarchical, precalculated rank derived from related Wikipedia page popularity, several identifiers and alternative names.

The dataset is designed for indexing by fulltext engines (for example SphinxSearch, ElasticSearch, etc) and can be applied in a geocoding service similar to the open-source Nominatim which served as a reference implementation.

The first version is of the project concentrates on basic search in place names.
Similar approach may be applied in future on POIs (points of interest), house numbers and address codes, and zip or postcodes.

The open-source project for generating the dataset is the result of the work of students from the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil, Switzerland in cooperation with the company Klokan Technologies GmbH, who has also developed the open-source geocoding search system with autocomplete functionality and offers commercial support and assistance with production deployment.
